There is a crisis in our sense making institutions - our media organizations, places of higher learning, and social media networks are turning dogmatic, dishonest, and tribal. Much of this trouble originates from a mistake in the philosophy that underlies how we approach sense making. The prevailing approach towards these institutions is based on answering the question, "Who Should We Trust." From this are derived further questions like "How do we ensure that our journalistic and academic classes are responsible and informed?", "Who should be allowed to participate in the process of sense making?", and "How should the gatekeepers be educated?"

These questions implicitly assert that there is such a thing as a trustworthy source which reliably avoids errors, and that this status is justified from raw data like the education and pedigree of the sense makers. I will call this misconception justificationism. According to this philosophy, our role is to identify the ideal source using questions like the ones above, and once we have done so, we make this source the measure of all truth. Criticizing the information and assumptions this source produces is a non-starter, since you have already established that all knowledge originates from this source.

##### Who Should We Trust encourages authoritarian and dogmatic thinking

When we debate our answers to the question "Who Should We Trust", we are not at all debating how successful the processes of error correction different sources are using will be. Instead, we are really deciding which source has in the past had the fewest errors. We are inducing from 

##### Who Should We Trust expects explanationless progress

To the extent that we should trust an institution of sense making, it is to the degree to which it explains from first principles how it reliably creates knowledge and prunes away errors. Saying that one source has created more knowledge than another in the past but not explaining why we should expect this to continue is not sufficient. Past success is not an indicator of how well an institution might fare in the future. This much is obvious when you consider the fact that when these supposedly 

##### Who Should We Trust prevents the correction of errors and the generation of new ideas and priorities

This is why it is necessary to generate a new institution of sense making - one that asks not, "Who should we trust?" but rather "How can we detect and eliminate errors while encouraging the creation of new ideas, and how can we do this using reason and persuasion instead of coercion and pressure?" This is the application of Popper's fallibilism to the organs of sense making. All institutions of sense making are conjectures about how to answer this question best. Unfortunately, almost all existing institutions fail to satisfy this criterion, since they have no actual explanation as to how they continually correct errors. Appeals to previous successes or to supposedly credible authorities are fallacious and turn institutions pathological in the long run.

This is why I am building a new platform for sense making.
