The most convincing of John Stuart Mill's arguments against censorship is that truth is better served by open opposition:

>However unwillingly a person who has a strong opinion may admit the possibility that his opinion may be false, he ought to be moved by the consideration that, however true it may be, if it is not fully, frequently, and fearlessly discussed, it will be held as a dead dogma, not a living truth ... Truth, thus held, is but one superstition the more, accidentally clinging to the words which enunciate a truth.
John Stuart Mill, On Liberty

The explanation for why censorship reliably melts truths into dogma is best provided by memetics.  

Memes uncontested on verity evolve towards falsity

Consider a true meme in the wild - the world is round, for instance. The meme finds (one of the variations lands upon) the optimal spreading strategy for this kind of rational meme: pair the true explanation with the evidence and reasoning which demonstrates its verity. 

Censorship requires destruction of institutions of criticism which protect the truth
