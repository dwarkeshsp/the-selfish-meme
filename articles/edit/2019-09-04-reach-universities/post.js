    "We expect universities to teach students to look beyond the circumstances of their own existence and towards a broader understanding of our collective circumstance. If the university's purpose is only to facilitate continual self-acquaintance, a student trying to get an education need never look beyond her diary and and bedroom mirror. There is something palpably tragic about the parochial error that universal knowledge about the reality we all share needs to be transformed in order to fit the meaningless and divisive classifications.",
