**Prompt:** *What good is freedom of speech if there are no facts? Ours has been called a post-truth era in which “fake news” rules and there’s no way to evaluate “your facts” versus “my facts.” Explore the ramifications for freedom of speech. In particular, explain whether the value of freedom of speech rests on the idea that no ‘truths’ are knowable, or on the idea that freedom of discussion is the best means to reach truth – or on something else.*

## Fallibilism and Freedom of Speech

That we still teach college students that knowledge is some form of justified true belief - where one has to claim by reference to an authoritative source or expert - is further evidence for the proposition that our knowledge of history has been reconciled to names and dates instead of lessons and explanations. A few despots still claim to rule by the “divine right of kings,” and many more promise that one person or party or book represents the irrefutable and absolute truth. But this childish instinct to look to some parochial and ultimately fallible authority for validation of our ideas has not gone away anywhere. 

Thus, we have the bewildering phenomenon of people thinking that their conjectures can withstand all refutation if they include a few more citations. The question, ‘How do you know…?’ is considered synonymous and interchangeable with ‘By whose authority do you claim…?’, as if a person needs some official license to think. This is the fallacy of justificationism - where the quest for truth is turned into a race for endorsements.

The person who wrote the prompt for this essay has either been taken in by this chimera or is hoping that we spot it. Does the existence of fake news and false assumptions mean there is no way to distinguish good ideas from bad ones? No. To make or contest a conjecture is to claim that you have better reasons to believe what you believe than your opponent, and whether some expert agrees with you or not is a complete non-sequitur.

In opposition to justificationism stands fallibilism - the view that no sovereign is so reliable and prescient and no ideology so perfectly conceived that they may relieve us of the burden of figuring out for ourselves what the truth is. A free speech absolutist (a title I happily wear), accepts - or should I say has good reason to accept - this most basic epistemological foundation. She is not claiming that true knowledge is unattainable or equivocating the veracity of all ideas, but she does expect even the most widely accepted theories to contain misconceptions as well as truth. To be a free speech absolutist is to claim that nothing can be absolute. Whereas the fallibilist expects future generations to be embarrassed by our mistakes and correct them, justificationists aim to secure their ideas against change. 

In addition to displacing parochial authorities from being the measure of truth, fallibilism and free speech also allow us to rise above of our individual misconceptions. Psychologists have found that human beings can be misled by hundreds of different cognitive biases. The consistent finding in psychological studies is that we are highly susceptible to motivated reasoning - where we figure out what we want to believe and then try to find reasons to believe it (although every person likes to think it’s working in the opposite direction for them). In the light of these disturbing facts, how can we mere apes, lacking all that we do and knowing all that we might be, with our amygdalas so big and our prefrontal cortexes so small, hope to make claims to verity? Do we not need some wise and paternal censor to grab us by the back of our heads and hold our gaze straight?

We have managed to do without for only the shortest window in our long history as a species. The thinkers of the Enlightenment, humbly recognizing their own fallibility, set up a process of institutionalized disconfirmation, where people make opposing conjectures - flawed and biased as they may be - and see if they can withstand criticism from those with the most motivation to disprove them. What emerges is a quasi-Darwinian process which the philosopher Karl Popper called conjecture and refutation - where the best variations of ideas are selected for as generations of bad ones go the way of the geocentric solar system and racialist pseudoscience. All of the subsequent moral, intellectual, and scientific advancement in our society has been the result of this collective project. But the first part of this mechanism for open-ended progress presupposes that we have the right to freely express our conjectures without knowing in advance whether they are correct. 

Thus, freedom of speech provides the two wheels without which the axle of history cannot move: a refusal to bow and silence ourselves to any authority and an insistence that our ideas be subjugated to the most brutal scrutiny that our peers can muster so that the best ones may survive. Only once have we ever managed to get the machine rolling. We stop it at our own peril.

## Facing the Lie

If we may allow ourselves to be so daring as to attempt to sum up all the classic texts on freedom of expression - which include John Stuart Mill’s essay *On Liberty*, Thomas Paine’s passionate defense of the *Rights of Man*, and John Milton’s *Areopagitica* (named after the famed hill of Athens that was the home of debate and discourse) - we find their nexus at the reversal of one of our central intuitions: the right of everyone in society to hear every speaker - even the most objectionable and misguided ones - is just as important, if not more important, than the right of the speaker to voice her opinion. Every time the government censors an opinion, it makes itself and the entire populace prisoners of their own ignorance; it makes everyone ignorant far too often of the facts, but in every case also of the mood of the country and the prevalence of certain opinions.

Does every sensible European not want to know how many people still believe that the Holocaust did not happen or are convinced that the Jews brought it upon themselves? Have the European countries that have banned Holocaust denial ever stopped to consider why, 73 years after the Nuremberg trials, people still deny this basic historical fact? 

During Adolf Hitler’s rise to power, the fuhrer’s fiercest critics realized it was of the utmost importance that the world studied *Mein Kampf* and know what the Nazi party would do once in power.[[1\]](https://sphere-strawberry-mece.squarespace.com/magazine/free-speech-and-truth-no-need-for-benevolent-censorship#_ftn1) Not enough people read it in time. Yet this book is still banned in many countries today. Have we not learned the lesson? Even now, these nations will close their eyes, cross their arms, and hope that when they next peek, the devil they’ve chosen to ignore will be gone. But if history is any guide, they will find that this devil their ancestors gave their lives chasing has turned around to greet them again.

The fact that we can live in a country where we know how many idiots believe their respective lunacies is a great privilege. And would we have it any other way? Do you not want to know that many Trump supporters believe that a man with Q level clearance in our intelligence agencies is keeping them updated on the President’s mission to destroy pedophilia in the deep state?[[2\]](https://sphere-strawberry-mece.squarespace.com/magazine/free-speech-and-truth-no-need-for-benevolent-censorship#_ftn2) Would you forsake the right to enjoy that irony, and more consequently, to know who needs to be convinced of what to get our collective bearings straight?

As for Europe’s counterproductive and reflexive censorious instinct, a study in 2017 from the Center for Research on Extremism concluded that “extensive public repression of radical right actors and opinions” is causing right-wing violence and terrorism and that “dialogue might then work better than exclusion, public repression, or aggressive confrontation.”[[3\]](https://sphere-strawberry-mece.squarespace.com/magazine/free-speech-and-truth-no-need-for-benevolent-censorship#_ftn3) This, too, is painfully obvious. To repress and censor conspiracy theorists and fanatics is to validate their belief that their views could withstand a collision with free debate and inquiry. These laws make it seem, especially to the conspiratorially inclined, that we have something to hide.

Most disastrously, laws against spreading these falsehoods make it harder for the rest of society to combat radicalism. Writers, journalists, and politicians in these countries have to function as blindfolded swordsmen, assigned the responsibility of defeating an enemy whose attacks and defenses they cannot see. How can you possibly fact check statements that were never made or point out fallacies that were never married to canvas? 

## Conversation or Violence

We may simply be fallible mammals, but so are the would-be jailers of our mental architecture. We may be wrong, but if our censors are wrong, as they almost always are, then we are left with no peaceful and democratic means to correct course. 

The only tools we have at our disposal to fuse our cognitive horizons and come to a consensus on how we create a flourishing global civilization are conversation and violence. Suppressing the former both requires and invites the latter. Only a state that is willing to jail and kill people for deviating from the ‘party line’ or the ‘official truth’ can enforce censorship, and when it does, it leaves dissidents with only one means of manifesting their conscience. The British government bans broadcasting by Irish separatists in 1988,[[4\]](https://sphere-strawberry-mece.squarespace.com/magazine/free-speech-and-truth-no-need-for-benevolent-censorship#_ftn4) making the paramilitary Irish Republican Army the only remaining vector of expression. And should a young South African lawyer named Nelson Mandela wish to protest apartheid, he is resigned to using thuggish tactics to get his racist rulers to end their oppression.[[5\]](https://sphere-strawberry-mece.squarespace.com/magazine/free-speech-and-truth-no-need-for-benevolent-censorship#_ftn5) When we cannot shout with words, we fight with bullets.

## The Benevolent Censor

In the spirit of free and open debate, I must encourage a rebuttal to my position. But I would be remiss if I did not demand that my opponents defend the opposite view, which requires us to find someone who we can appoint to the title of censor. I, for one, have never met a person to whom I would delegate the responsibility of deciding for me what the unquestionable lies are and who the unpardonable liar is, and I am suspicious of anyone who claims to have enough knowledge and authority to annex this right. The claim to possess exclusive truth can only be made by the most arrogant and confused person, and it should come as no surprise to anyone that the most brutal control freaks of history, from Stalin to Khomeini to Kim Jong-Un, are united in their assertion that they know everything they need to know and that they’ve known it for a long time. Theocrats who claim to be privy to the thoughts and desires of the Creator of the universe are by their nature the most hazardous and overzealous censors. These are the sorts of people who would be happy to relieve you of the burden of hearing what you might have to hear, and we shake our heads and oscillate our fingers at the peoples throughout history who have accepted that same terrible insult that every Grand Rabbi and Chief Ayatollah and Supreme Pontiff and Dear Leader has thrown at them: you’re not good enough to know virtue from vice, and you have neither the right nor the capacity to decide for yourselves who is being reasonable and who is being absurd. We wonder how anyone was duped into believing that if they simply gave up their critical thinking faculties and forfeited their most intimate rights, a world of idiotic bliss could be theirs. 

But did we notice in late February of this year that the Secretary-General of the United Nations stood before the Human Rights Council and assigned himself the responsibility of censoring the “insidious campaign” of “false narratives” against the Global Compact on Migration,[[6\]](https://sphere-strawberry-mece.squarespace.com/magazine/free-speech-and-truth-no-need-for-benevolent-censorship#_ftn6) which was rejected by countries like our own?[[7\]](https://sphere-strawberry-mece.squarespace.com/magazine/free-speech-and-truth-no-need-for-benevolent-censorship#_ftn7) Did we forget that Eleanor Roosevelt, the chair of the UN Commission on Human Rights, opposed the censorship clause in the International Bill of Human Rights because it was “likely to be exploited by totalitarian States for the purpose of rendering the other articles null and void[?]”[[8\]](https://sphere-strawberry-mece.squarespace.com/magazine/free-speech-and-truth-no-need-for-benevolent-censorship#_ftn8) Does our amnesia extend all the way to Rwanda (where the Genocide Denial Laws are being used to suppress criticism of President Kagame),[[9\]](https://sphere-strawberry-mece.squarespace.com/magazine/free-speech-and-truth-no-need-for-benevolent-censorship#_ftn9) Venezuela (where Maduro’s illegitimate regime is using similar laws for similar ends),[[10\]](https://sphere-strawberry-mece.squarespace.com/magazine/free-speech-and-truth-no-need-for-benevolent-censorship#_ftn10) and all the other repressive paternal countries that tell their people that only the benevolent censor can illuminate the shadow between what the populous thinks they know and what the state knows to be the case?

It is our responsibility as thinking people to say that we have no need for this nonsense and that we will not fold our posture to appease these grand imposters.
