The nucleotides of our DNA copy themselves by replicating a negative. The purpose of the dual stranded stringing is that the compounds on one end as a template for the other when copying. An adenine will spawn a thymine, which will return the favor by reconstituting the adenine. Such is the nature of positive-negative replication: the replicator creates a "negative" which recreates itself. From the perspective of the negative, the same is true.

So it is for memes as well. Imagine an idea which depends not on spreading itself faithfully but of goading a response which will resuscitate itself. Quickly, one gets a sore neck from following the ricochet of these reactionary reflections.

The memes animating the martyrs of history come to mind. Many a revolution owes its success not to persuasion by common means but the radicalization and over-reaction of the rulers in response to seditious memes. These subversive ideas troll governments into stupid responses (martial law, killing and imprisoning dissenters, dissolving political norms and institutions) which ironically prove and amplify the original point.

Memes are not done yet, for unlike simple organic replicators who utilize this strategy, they can mix and match. A clever meme could both cause itself to replicate to the susceptible demographic through conventional means and provoke on a counter-reaction from horrified partisans on the other side. Each is an ember for the other, with resultant flame being the instigating meme.

Perhaps the spread of the Protestant meme depended upon the violence between the aggrieved papacy and the fiesty heretics, where the actions of each provoked a response from the other. In the shadow of centuries of religious barbarism, the meme that sowed the motion feasted on the commotion.

P.S. More germane to today's politics is something I came across online:

> No one needs neo-nazis like the woke left, and nobody needs the woke left like neo-nazis.
