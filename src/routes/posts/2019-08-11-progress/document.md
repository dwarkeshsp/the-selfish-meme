The library was arranged chronologically

but that didn’t much matter

The young buck could have started in any century

He could have tapped into any chatter

And he would notice with growing unease

As he dropped down the manifestos carried by history’s breeze

That the same old grotesque and idiotic and confused

Was infused with every clatter

Thus he would wonder whether he had been lied to

By Heraclitus and his kin

Of progress, of change

Of the mistaken’s inevitable chagrin.
