The nucleotides of our DNA copy themselves by creating a negative. The purpose of the dual stranded stringing is that the compounds on one strand act as a template for the other when replicating. An adenine will spawn a thymine in its relative place on the chromosome which will return the favor by reconstituting the adenine. Such is the nature of positive-negative replication: the replicator creates a negative which recreates the original positive.  

So it is for memes as well. Imagine an idea which depends not on spreading itself faithfully but of goading a response that acts in its favor. One gets a sore neck from following the ricochet of reactions caused by these reflections.

The memes animating the martyrs of history come to mind. Many a revolution owes its success not to persuasion by common means but the radicalization and over-reaction of the rulers in response to seditious memes. These subversive ideas troll governments into stupid responses (martial law, killing and imprisoning dissenters, dissolving political norms and institutions) which ironically prove and amplify the original point.

Memes are not done yet, for unlike simple organic replicators who utilize this strategy, they can mix and match. A clever meme could both cause itself to be spread to a sympathetic demographic through conventional means and at the same time provoke a counter-reaction from horrified partisans on the other side. Each is an ember for the other, with the instigating meme forming the resultant frame.

Perhaps the spread of the Protestant meme depended upon the violence between the aggrieved papacy and the fiesty heretics, where the actions of each provoked a response from the other. In the shadow of centuries of religious barbarism, the meme that sowed the motion feasted on the commotion.

P.S. More germane to today's politics is following insight I came across online:

> No one needs neo-nazis like the woke left, and nobody needs the woke left like neo-nazis.

The two are indeed mirror reflections of a single replicator. Irony fiends will be pleased to learn that mortal enemies are often the hosts and captive of the exact same meme.
