Just a few minutes ago, I was enthralled in a festivity here at UT called Party on the Plaza. All the students organizations get a chance to introduce themselves to prospective members at the beginning of the year in a crowded daze of flyers, elevator pitches, and small talk. One can take immense pleasure from the richochets between the balroom dancing club and the powerlifting team and the laern to code organization. The intention behind this bazaar of novelty is to promote the old but true cliche of college expanding a young person's horizons. 

But when a pre-med Philipino girl joins the Asian Doctors Club and the Women in Science Club, has she really expanded her horizons? A full quarter of the students orgs that showed up to this event were based in their charter and name on parochial concerns about gender, race, nationality, and ethnic backgrounds. One would think that the entire point of going to a large public univeristy is to escape the confining grips of these arbirtary and meanignless classifications and explore the wild landscape of knowledge with peers whom one considers capable of doing the same. 

Unless the programming women do is categorically distinct from programming proper, encouring women to join the Women in Computer Science club is both insulting and restrictive. It is insulting because it implies that women need some special assistance or space to succeed in CS where other groups don't and it is restrictive because it confines and triviazes the open-ended  and far-reaching search for knowledge under the heels of the most banal and self-centered considerations possible. 

What is the product of this ghoulish machinery of confusion, classification, and inwardness? One remember the paper product of Michelle Obama's undergraduate education which Christopher Hitchens thus summed up:

I direct your attention to Mrs. Obama’s 1985 thesis at Princeton University. Its title (rather limited in scope, given the author and the campus) is “Princeton-Educated Blacks and the Black Community.” To describe it as hard to read would be a mistake; the thesis cannot be “read” at all, in the strict sense of the verb. This is because it wasn’t written in any known language. 

The subject of the thesis is both laughable and concerning. But why? Because we expect universities to teach students to look beyond the circustances of their own existence and towards a broader understading of our collective circumstance. If the university's purpose is only to facilitate continual self-aquintance, a student need never have left the vision in her bedroom mirror to get an education.
