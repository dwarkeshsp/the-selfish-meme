## The Opportune Moment

One particular chimera has been more effective than any other at diverting the attention and energy we need to combat Chinese fascism. Foreign Affairs Magazine recently published an essay insisting that the marriage of authoritarianism and economic growth in China is due for the same sort of divorce that liberalized South Korea's political system by 1987. There are at least a few reasons why these sorts of predictions shouldn't comfort us.

For one, we've been sold this same meme for decades - China is bound for a rendezvous with democracy and political liberty. Echoes of these sorts of optimistic pronouncements still ring back from the days of Mao. Those who still find conciliation here must answer two questions. First, by when does China have to fail to become a reasonably free society for you to admit that you were wrong? They're already the world's largest economy. Do we wait until they have remade the international order in their favor? Finding out that China will remain an autocracy beyond the point where it becomes more powerful than any democracy is useless. Indeed, if out conclusion on the ultimate sustainability of fascism in China is to be useful at all, it must be made now. For the time being, there is no reason to think that the fundamental cruelty, dehumanization, and collectivization of the Communist Party stands no chance survival against a collision with the 21st century. It's possible that they will liberalize, but it's far more likely that new advancements in computer vision, surveillance, and biotech will embolden the Stalinist strands of the Chinese program. No doubt these pillars of modern totalitarianism will find their way across the globe either by imitation or subjugation.

Anyone who is agnostic about such dystopian futures lacks a commitment to the premises of the American Republic and thus its ultimate project. Americans believe in freedom of conscience and the sovereignty of the individual not because people magically receive certain arbitrary privileges upon stepping on our soil like some sort of geographically activated appendage. Those same rights which we reserve for ourselves must either apply to all human beings or none. If people's natural rights are simply a walk in the desert away from vanishing, how real were they in the first place? Our Founders recognized that only governments deriving their power from the will of a sovereign people are legitimate because they uniquely allow for the flourishing of their denizens. Only they make allowances for the fallibility of their leaders and diversity of their citizens.

In rejecting an invitation due to poor health to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence, its author Thomas Jefferson (who was eerily fated to die on the day of that celebration) wrote:

> May it be to the world, what I believe it will be, (to some parts sooner, to others later, but finally to all,) the signal of arousing men to burst the chains under which monkish ignorance and superstition had persuaded them to bind themselves, and to assume the blessings and security of self-government.

By the way, how I like to imagine the gracious invitee responded:

> Dude,

> You could've just said no.
