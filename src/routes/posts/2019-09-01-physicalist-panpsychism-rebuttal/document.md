## Experience cannot be foundational

In the light of this it proposes that the most natural and parsimonious hypothesis is that all concrete reality is experiential.

Panpsychism claims that experience has to be fundamental to the nature of *stuff*. Since we know that we can experience and since it is hard to imagine how and why experience could be the unique property of just the matter that constitutes our minds, panpsychists believe it is most likely that experience is foundational to the nature of all matter.

However, if experience is foundational, then a theory of consciousness (ie the explanation for how the machinery of experience works) would be the foundational theory in all of science and philosophy. Consciousness would have to be to every other scientific theory what relativity is to cosmology. The former in both cases is the deeper theory because the latter is both cases is an emergent phenomenon 

To see why this is true, consider the burdens on a theory of quantum mechanics (which also claims to be the fundamental theory). It has to be such that it not only explains quantum phenomenon but also how the emergent properties of such phenomenon can constitute

## Hence, panpsychism explains nothing about consciousness

I submit to you that any theory whose verity hinges on an appeal to ignorance and which does not offer a compelling reason for why that ignorance is in principle unsurmountable should be dismissed. If the very idea of learning more about the nature of reality (you know, the point of science) is incompatible with panpsychism, so much the worse for panpsychists.

## Panpsychism is unfalsifiable

The measure of good scientific theories are that they are hard to vary explanations that actually explain the underlying phenomenon and that they are testable (Deutsch 2012). Panpsychism fails on both accounts. 

## The combination problem is non-trivial; panpschic unity does not answer

Panscpyism has a double standard for the combination problem and radical emergence
